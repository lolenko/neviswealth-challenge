# Nevis Wealth Challenge

Thank you for the interesting home assignment. Due to limited time, I focused on the frontend and the composition of React components, implementing only the properties necessary for rendering the provided designs. I would be happy to discuss in person during our potential meeting the approach I would take and what I would design first if more time were available.
